resistiveCoefficient: Estimation from a random article (http://hpwizard.com/tire-friction-coefficient.html)
tireRadius:
Based on unloaded RM 25 tires
Constant below 200 kph
mu = rolling resistance / (weight * cos(inclineAngle))
mu = Fx / Fz
Rolling resistance is the force necessary to pull the axle of a tire horizontally in the direction of travel

MISSING ITEMS
ITERATIVELY GRAPH DATA (zsTime - zero to sixty time, torque curve) USING EQUATIONS
 -> Graph 0-60 time with respect to gear ratios THEN create torque curve at each value?

FUTURE GOALS
1. Find an actual value for resistive coefficient
 -> TTC: https://www.fsaettc.org/viewtopic.php?t=193&sid=88c5b9421b543e327d02bfdaf2b3eb44
 -> Applied Dimensional Analysis and modeling Ch. 8
 -> https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/rolling-resistance-coefficient
 -> According to TTC forums, finding rolling resistance may be impossible
2. Account for tire rolling radius or loaded radius (maybe)
 -> rollingRadius (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQl5_x3Aijs) RM 25: 16.0x7.5-10 R25B (Hoosier 43075)
 -> Spring rate data https://www.hoosiertire.com/contingency_rates/fas/
 -> TTC shows rolling radius at different RPMs, Temps, etc
3. Account for chain stretch
4. Account for different motor setup?
5. Including calculations using efficiency rather than internal system friction


FUNCTIONS
def output_torque(carVelocity, gearRatio):
    tireAngularVelocity = carVelocity / tireRadius
    h = 2 * math.pi * tireRadius * gearRatio
    a = CARMASS * tireRadius * gearRatio
    b = AIRDENSITY * AREA * h ^ 2 * (DRAGCOEFFICIENT + 4 * LIFTCOEFFICIENT * RESISTIVECOEFFICIENT)
    c = 4 * RESISTIVECOEFFICIENT * CARWEIGHT * math.cos(INCLINEANGLE) + CARWEIGHT * math.sin(INCLINEANGLE)
    tireAngularAcceleration = 0  # Unsure how to get this number
    return MOMENTINERTIA * tireAngularAcceleration + gearRatio * tireRadius * (a * tireAngularAcceleration + b * (tireAngularVelocity ^ 2) + c) + INTERNALFRICTION
